# PrayerTimesChicago

Displays the local prayer time in Chicago according to baitulilm.org website. 

## How it was made

I developed this app for my parents, because baitulilm.org takes a long time to load. I developed a webscraper with Node.js that scrapes baitulilm.org for the local prayer times. This app, which was made with Flutter, simply displays the daily prayer times.
